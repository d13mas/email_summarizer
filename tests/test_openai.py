Hi John,

I just wanted to follow up on the meeting we had yesterday regarding the new product launch timeline. 
After checking with the marketing and engineering teams, we believe we can move the release up by two weeks 
without impacting quality. Iâ€™ll sync with the QA team tomorrow to confirm test coverage and dependencies.

Let me know if you're aligned. We can finalize the comms plan by Friday.

Thanks,
Emily
